## 👷 About the Project

**Electrical Tools** is built by **Shashank (Electrician)** to solve real on-site calculation problems faced during house wiring and inverter planning.

The website provides **accurate, field-tested calculations** for:
- Load estimation
- Wire size selection
- MCB & RCCB rating
- Inverter & battery sizing
- Conduit / casing-capping estimation
- Electrical laws & safety rules

All tools work **offline in the browser** and require **no login**.
